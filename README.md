# Blue Pearl Financial ISSP Project

## Prospecting Page

This page is used to view all the leads the company has into potential applicants.

### Top of the page

Below the master NavBar you'll see what the page is all about (in case you forget). 
The card blocks after, are statistics of the what the individual broker has done.
And finally (not implemented yet), the auto dialer for calls to come in one at a time on a time gap between and start session (not implemented yet) will call a specific lead to get into the call dashboard (not the same as the call analysis dashboard but similiar to a discord call). 

### The main content

After all of that, we have the priority prospects organized by the date and colored tags (Hot, Warm, Cold). 
Each of them have a call and message button (not implemented yet), each with obvious uses. The call button will go to the call dashboard, and the message button will open up a dm's dashboard of all the Brokers messages all of their leads/applicants.

We also have a Today's Challenge card which can be modified by either the manager or a personal goal of the broker (more lientient towards the manager).

The Call's Script are a reminder of sorts to remind brokers how the call should go usually (best case).
